 <img class ="image" src="1.jpg" alt="Osideinde Oluwadara"/><p>Back in 2001, when i was 13.5 years young, my family bought a <mark>56k modem.</mark>
 My parents would only allow me to use the web 1 hour a week, so i saved up my allowance,
  bought a 150' phone cable, drilled a couple 1" holes in the wood floor while my parents were
   out, and army-crawled under the house to rout the phone cable to my room. I pieced back 
   together a crappy old <mark>IBM Thinkpad 600</mark> and would tiptoe at night to the office
    to switch the 56k modem over to my rooms cable-hack to play <mark>Age of Empires I</mark>
	 online for hours on end, sometimes till dawn.</p>
<p>6 years later, during my Freshmen at <mark>SDSU,</mark> i recieved a phone call from my father
about some<br>strange holes he discovered in the wood floor while my parents were selling the house. Needless to say, <br>at the time he wasn't <mark>thrilled</mark> at how stunning creative i had been in circumventing their moratorium on<br> the internet, however in retrospect i now realize drilling those holes in the floor was one of the best things<br> i ever did as it was in that i fell in love with computers.</p>
<p>Currently <mark>i help the internet faster.</mark> On my free-time i help motivate others to learn to code through<br> my own experiences.
I get stoked on creative people on creative people and life altering ideas.</p>

	<h4><mark>How to Disable WPAD in Windows</mark></h4>
	<img class="wpda" src="2.jpg"/>
	<br>This attack can be carried out on <mark>Linux, Mac, or Windows systems,</mark> 
	but primarily the latter since it is the only one that is enabled by default with <mark>Internet Explorer</mark>.<br> 
	WPAD is not <mark>automatically enabled</mark> in <mark>Mac OS X or Linux, nor on Safari, Chrome, or Firefox browsers,</mark> 
	so you shouldn't have to do anything on your end to protect<br> yourself unless you use <mark>Microsoft Windows.</mark>

To disable WPAD in Windows, you'll need to make an easy registry edit, as StackExchange user laktak points out:<br>
                            <h4><MARK>STEPS TO DISABLE WPAD IN Windows</MARK><h4>
<mark>1)</mark>Click the Start button, and in the search field, type in "regedit", then select "regedit.exe" from the list of results.<br>
<mark>2)</mark>Navigate through the tree to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Wpad.<br>
<mark>3)</mark>Once you have the "Wpad" folder selected, right click in the right pane, and click on "New -> DWORD (32-Bit Value)".<br>
<mark>4)</mark>Name this new value "WpadOverride".<br>
<mark>5)</mark>Double click the new "WpadOverride" value to edit it.<br>
<mark>6)</mark>In the "Value data" field, replace the "0" with a "1", then click "OK".<br>
<mark>7)</mark>Reboot the computer.<br>

	<h3>OPEN SOURCE</h3>
	Open source refers to a program or software in which the source code (the form of the program when a programmer writes a program in a particular 
	programming language) is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.<br>
	<mark>Here is a list of what I feel to be the best or most notable open source applications:</mark>
	<h3><mark><pre>
	*<a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu: This is another OS just like windows, IOS, etc. But it deals mainly with command line</a>
	*<a href="https://pidgin.im/">Pigdin: This is an IRC for secure chats if youre saying somethuing illegal (just kidding)</a>
	*<a href="www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip: I guess we're all familiar woth winrar. Well i would say this is better than winrar in some ways</a>
	*<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox: Well if you don't about this yet then you shouldn't be reading this</a>
	*<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org: OpenOffice is the leading open-source office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics and more. </a>
	*<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird:  is a free, open source, cross-platform email, news, RSS, and chat client developed by the <mark>Mozilla Foundation</mark></a>
	*<a href="www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC Media Player: This is probably the most downloaded software in <mark>Nigerian Universities</mark></a>
